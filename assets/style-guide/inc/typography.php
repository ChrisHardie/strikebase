<h2 class="panel-title">Typography</h2>

<p>Because Strikebase is primarily an app, we&rsquo;re using system fonts for all of the UI text. By a happy coincidence, system fonts are looking pretty good these days, although I&rsquo;m probably biased by spending the majority of my days working on a Mac.</p>

<h3>Line height</h3>

<p>Line-height is universally set at 1.4, which is a nice comfortable height for body copy. For headings, the line height is a bit tighter.</p>

<p>Keeping the line height of text consistent helps maintain a balanced baseline. As a general rule, only change the line height if you have a specific reason for doing so.</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>

<div class="typography-headings">
	<span class="label">Heading one</span>
	<h1>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h1>

	<span class="label">Heading two</span>
	<h2>Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt</h2>

	<span class="label">Heading three</span>
	<h3>The five boxing wizards jump quickly</h3>

	<span class="label">Heading four</span>
	<h4>Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow</h4>
