<h2 class="panel-title">Typography</h2>

<p>Because Strikebase is primarily an app, we&rsquo;re using system fonts for all of the UI text. By a happy coincidence, system fonts are looking pretty good these days, although I&rsquo;m probably biased by spending the majority of my days working on a Mac.</p>

<h3>Line height</h3>

<p>Line-height is universally set at 1.4, which is a nice comfortable height for body copy. For headings, the line height is a bit tighter.</p>

<p>Keeping the line height of text consistent helps maintain a balanced baseline. As a general rule, only change the line height if you have a specific reason for doing so.</p>

<h1>Heading one</h1>
<h2>Heading two</h2>
<h3>Heading three</h3>
<h4>Heading four</h4>
<h5>Heading five</h5>
<h6>Heading six</h6>
